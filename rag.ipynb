            "Q1: What’s the trade-off between bias and variance? Answer: Bias is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm you’re using. This can lead to the model  underfitting your data, making it hard for it to have high predictive accuracy and for \n",

            "being highly sensitive to high degrees of variation in your training data, which can lead your model \n",
            "to overfit the data. You’ll b e carrying too much noise from your training data for your model to be very useful \n",

            "the model more complex and add more variables, you’ll lose bias but gain some variance — in order to get the \n",

            "your labeled groups. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, does not require labeling data explicitly. Q3: How is KNN different from k-means clustering? Answer: K-Nearest Neighbors is a  supervised classification algorithm , while  k-means clustering  is \n",
